   	<li>Fork the instructor's repo named octocat</li>
	<li>Download an octocat image for each team member from the Internet. Size the image to 400 x 400 if you are familiar with image editing tools such as Photoshop or Picasa etc. If you are not familar with any of these tools then get help from another student or the instructor.</li>
	<li>Save the image in the <strong>images</strong> folder.

	<li>Delete the other student's names, however, keep your team member's names</li>
